This is a python script for taking an input file 1 (on filesystem 1) and an input file 2 (on filesystem 2), and swapping them, using a specified
swap buffer/space.
The end result should be file 1 on filesystem 2, and file 2 on filesystem 1.
The algorithm is roughly sketched out in: 'README2.pdf'.
Even though this is a python script, there are strict OS requirements (see below).

Why/when would you use this? When you are performing data recovery. Suppose you have a filesystem images whose sizes are in the order of terabytes.
Sometimes you may need to juggle these round. For example, you may need to put a 1 TB recovered image file currently residing on a 1 TB disk, onto
a 4 TB disk that has a 500 GB image file + 500 GB free space. In this case you want to swap the 1 TB image with the 500 GB image. If you were to do
this manually, there are a number of approaches but all would involve some kind of swap space or interim buffer. This script automates all of this.
You just specify the swap destination, how much space to provision for the swap buffer, and away you go.

TO DO:
- More testing!



OS: must be Linux (developed/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
Filesystem1: probably should be ext4
Filesystem2: probably should be ext4
Swap buffer: not hard requirements i don't believe
